  <h3>Idea</h3>

  <p>The aim of this project is to extend the paper <i> Generalization and Replication in Computational Social
      Science</i> from Hai Liang and King-wa Fu.
    This paper managed to create a representative random sample of Twitter users account and tested some propositions that comes from
    other social media research paper.
    Our extension was to keep this network created by the research paper authors and propose two new
    propositions to test with the sample.
    These propositions come from some suppositions, some expectations about social media features, that we had in Kali
    data scientists group.
    Indeed, we thought naively that :
  <ul>
    <li>There is a monthly usage pattern (certainly people post more during holidays/celebrations!) </li>
    <li>There is a way to predict a user's future activity based on his number of followers, the number of posts </li>
  </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    <div>
      <h3>Monthly Rhythms</h3>
      <p class="blocktext">
      Let's first look at how much do people posts during a year.
      </p>
          <div class="grid-container">
              <div class="grid-child one">
                  <p class="blockimage">
                  <img src="/assets/images/month2011.png" class="full_width" />
                  </p>
              </div>
              <div class="grid-child two">
                  <p class="blocktext">
                   As those three graphs show us, there exists only few similarities between the years :  in January, February and March, users tend to always post fewer tweets while the rest
                  of the months do not seem to follow a defined pattern. We come up with two possible explanations:
                  First of all, the end of year’s holidays are over and people tend to rest or go on vacation (mainly in swiss ski stations we hope), therefore having less time to post on Twitter. 
  
                   </p>
              </div>
          </div>
          <div class="grid-container">
              <div class="grid-child one">
                  <p class="blocktext">
                   The other may be that content creator, such as Youtubers and advertisers,
                   take their vacation at this time of the year. In fact a lot of expensive ads are created before Christmas as they generate a lot of revenue and 
                   way less at the start of the year as there are no celebrations. 
                   Now, content creators’ wages are highly dependent on ads thus making those months, especially January, less profitable.
                   Therefore, a large portion of them decides to go on vacation at this moment (once again, we hope in swiss ski stations),
                    making less content for people to interact about on social medias.
                   </p>
              </div>
              <div class="grid-child two">
                  <p class="blockimage">
                  <img src="/assets/images/month2012.png" class="full_width" />
                  </p>
              </div>
          </div>
          <div class="grid-container">
              <div class="grid-child one">
                  <p class="blockimage">
                  <img src="/assets/images/month2013.png" class="full_width" />
                  </p>
              </div>
              <div class="grid-child two">
                  <p class="blocktext">
                   Now, if we take a look at the other months, we can not really point out a month that is always bigger than the others or distinguish any pattern. 
                   This might be explained by different events which create a lot of discussion/post,
                   such as the US election in late 2011 or the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Euro_2012" style="text-decoration-line: underline;">UEFA EURO in June 2012</a>.
                   Furthermore, the distribution  appears to become more uniform as the user database grows. Indeed we see that overall, the number of tweets increased by 550%
                   from 2011 to 2013.
                   
                   </p>
              </div>
          </div>
  </div>
  </p>
  <p>We thus wanted to check if events had a real influence on how people tweet. We take the example of the Euro. <br> 
    Looking at the number of tweets made in 2012 by Spanish speakers, who are huge football fans and followed the adventure of their team from start to finish,
    a clear spike appears in June compared to the other years.
    </p>

    <div class="grid-container">
      <div class="grid-child one">
          <img src="/assets/images/spanish2011.png" />

      <div class="grid-child two">
        <img src="/assets/images/spanish2012.png"  />
      </div>

      <div class="grid-child three">

      </div>
      <div class="grid-child four">
        <p>
          This example strengthens the hypothesis that there is no monthly pattern. It's a lot more probable that the number of tweets is correlated to 
          what happens during the year, thus being highly influenced by predictable or unpredictable events.
          We could for example imagine that the number of tweets for the year 2020 would explode around
          March/April because of COVID and around October/November because of this historic US election, having a president that tweets a lot.

  <h3>How much will a user tweet?</h3>
  <p>
    Can we predict how much a user will post in 2020, knowing how many followers, followees he has and how those features evolved since 2014. Of course not! 
    But we still tried just to prove that human behaviour is highly unpredictable.
  </p>
  <h4>Train step</h4>
    <p>
    First of all, we went with a blunt try and kept the data unchanged (Spoiler Alert: didn't work well...). We tried 2 different models to predict those values.
    One was Ridge Regression, the other was a Gradient Boosting Regression model. <br>
    As we are conscientious (aspiring) Data Scientists, we first performed some cross-validation on the dataset. We used the R<sup>2</sup> value to choose our hyperparameter. 
    </p>
    <p class="images">
      <div class="grid-container">
        <div class="grid-child one">
            <img src="/assets/images/CrossValRidge.png" />
        </div>
        
        <div class="grid-child two">
          <img src="/assets/images/CrossValGBR.png"  />
        </div>
      </div>
    </p>
  
    <p>
    Those graphs seem to show, in addition to the best hyperparameters for both models, that Gradient Boosting manages to explain slightly better the data compared to
    Ridge Regression.
    We see that Ridge Regression performs very poorly unless the alpha parameter is in the order of 10<sup>10</sup> Gradient Boosting however doesn't change much on based on
    the learning rate for the best model.
    </p>
    <h4>Test our best models</h4>
    <p>
      Now that we have our prepared our models and found the best hyperparameters, let's test them.
    </p>
    <p class="images">
      <div class="grid-container">
        <div class="grid-child one">
            <img src="/assets/images/rrpred.png" />
        </div>
        
        <div class="grid-child two">
          <img src="/assets/images/gbrpred.png"  />
        </div>
      </div>
    </p>
    <p>
    Okay. That is a bit embarassing. Both methods seem to give quite poor results.  
    In reality, both these methods seem to give quite poor results. First of all, each model has a tendency to find some negative values, Gradient Boosting more than Ridge, which we know is impossible as no users could have a negative number of tweets. A reason this might occur is the existence of a reduction in the number of tweets for some user, in fact some user might have deleted their tweets for whatever reason, meaning that the number of tweets over time is going down. Then, we can clearly see a sort of constant at the start of each graph, with the one of Gradient Boosting being lower even though less visible than the one of Ridge, meaning that the models do not distinguish lower values very well.
    All in all, it is unlikely to be able to predict the number of tweets a user will be making in 6 years based on some old data, because the number of tweets made by an account does not seem to correlate with the number of followers a user has.
    
    Some idea to perform better would be to have a better history of the account, maybe on a year by year basis instead of a chunk of many year all in one category.
