  <h3>Idea</h3>

  <p>The aim of this project is to extend the paper <i> Generalization and Replication in Computational Social
      Science</i> from Hai Liang and King-wa Fu.
    This paper managed to create a representative random sample of Twitter users account and tested some propositions that comes from
    other social media research paper.
    Our extension was to keep this network created by the research paper authors and propose two new
    propositions to test with the sample.
    These propositions come from some suppositions, some expectations about social media features, that we had in Kali
    data scientists group.
    Indeed, we thought naively that :
  <ul>
    <li>There is a monthly usage pattern (certainly people post more during holidays/celebrations!) </li>
    <li>There is a way to predict a user's future activity based on his number of followers, the number of posts </li>
  </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    <div>
      <h4>Results</h4>
      <h5>Monthly Rhythms</h5>
      <p class="blocktext">
      Let's first look at how much do people posts during a year.
      </p>
          <div class="grid-container">
              <div class="grid-child one">
                  <p class="blockimage">

                  </p>
              </div>
              <div class="grid-child two">
                  <p class="blocktext">
                   As those three graphs show us, there exists only few similarities between the years :  in January, February and March, users tend to always post fewer tweets while the rest
                  of the months do not seem to follow a defined pattern. We come up with two possible explanations:
                  First of all, the end of year’s holidays are over and people tend to rest or go on vacation (mainly in swiss ski stations we hope), therefore having less time to post on Twitter. 
  
                   </p>
              </div>
          </div>
          <div class="grid-container">
              <div class="grid-child one">
                  <p class="blocktext">
                   The other may be that content creator, such as Youtubers and advertisers,
                   take their vacation at this time of the year. In fact a lot of expensive ads are created before Christmas as they generate a lot of revenue and 
                   way less at the start of the year as there are no celebrations. 
                   Now, content creators’ wages are highly dependent on ads thus making those months, especially January, less profitable.
                   Therefore, a large portion of them decides to go on vacation at this moment (once again, we hope in swiss ski stations),
                    making less content for people to interact about on social medias.

                  <p class="blocktext">
                   Now, about the other months, there seems to be a different case for each year, this might be explained by different events which create a lot of discussion/post,
                  such as the US election in late 2011 or the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Euro_2012" style="text-decoration-line: underline;">UEFA EURO in June 2012</a>. 
                  Looking at the number of tweets made in 2012 by Spanish speakers, who are huge football fans and followed the adventure of their team from start to finish,
                  a clear spike appears on June compared to the other years.

  </p>

  <p>
    This shows that there is no monthly pattern as the number of tweets seems to be correlated to what happens during the year, thus being highly influenced by
    predictable or unpredictable events. We could for example imagine that the number of tweets for the year 2020 would explode around
    March/April because of COVID and around October/November because of this historic US election, having a president that tweets a lot.
