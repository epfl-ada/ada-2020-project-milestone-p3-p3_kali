    <h4>Abstract</h4>
        <p>
        This study aim to explore a sample of Twitter user data over multiple years to see whether user activity increase every year in some months and decrease some other. For exemple, is there more user activity in December than in July.
        To so so we used the dataset provided by the authors of the paper we are trying to extend. 
        We based this decision on the fact that about status, twitter api only allowed to grab recent tweets, and that the way of sampling realized in this paper is interesting and we did not wanted to denaturate it.

                 As those three graphs are showing us, there exists only few similarities between the years : January, February and March are always at the end, while the rest of the months do not seem to follow a defined pattern. This might be explained in different ways : One hypothesis, the craziness of the Decemberâ€™s holidays is over, the people are slowing down, resting, thus posting less on social medias.
