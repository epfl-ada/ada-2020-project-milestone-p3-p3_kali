  <h2>Data Story</h2>

  <h3>Idea</h3>

  <p>The aim of this project is to extend the paper <i> Generalization and Replication in Computational Social
      Science</i> from Hai Liang and King-wa Fu.
    This paper aims to create a sample of Twitter users network and test on it some propositions that comes from
    other social media research paper.
    So our extension was to keep this user network created by the research paper authors and to propose two new
    propositions to test with the sample.
    These propositions come from some suppositions, some expectations about social media features, that we had in Kali
    data scientists group.
    Indeed, we thought naively that :
  <ul>
    <li>There is a monthly usage pattern</li>
    <li>There is a way to predict from its account features if a user will remain on Twitter</li>
  </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Discover on the website results and Dataset used to test these propositions</b>
